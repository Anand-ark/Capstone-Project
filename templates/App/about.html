    <p style="color:FloralWhite;">The prediction about the disease is made with the help of the machine learning and deep learning model which itself is trained on the thousands of the datasets</p>
    <p style="color:FloralWhite;">So with the following paragraph I gonna be describing about the types of the diseases which gonna be getting deployed in this app.</p>

<p style="color:FloralWhite;text-align:justify;">In pneumonia, the lungs become filled with fluid and inflamed, leading to breathing difficulties. For some people, breathing problems can become severe enough to require treatment at the hospital with oxygen or even a ventilator.<br>
  The pneumonia that COVID-19 causes tends to take hold in both lungs. Air sacs in the lungs fill with fluid, limiting their ability to take in oxygen and causing shortness of breath, cough and other symptoms.<br></p>

<h3 style="color:FloralWhite;">Symptoms</h3>
 <ul>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Difficulty breathing or shortness of Breath</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Chest pain or pressure</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Loss of speech or movement</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Fever, Dry Cough, Tiredness</li>
</ul>
